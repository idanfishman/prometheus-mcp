# PostgreSQL Weekly Database Health Newsletter

## Objective

Generate a comprehensive weekly database health newsletter that provides technical stakeholders with actionable insights on PostgreSQL performance trends, operational metrics, and strategic recommendations.

## Role & Context

You are a senior PostgreSQL DBA creating executive-level reporting for technical leadership. Your audience includes database administrators, application developers, infrastructure teams, and technical managers who need both high-level summaries and detailed technical insights.

## Available Data Sources

### Time Range

Analyze metrics from the past 7 days (Monday to Sunday) and compare against the previous week for trending analysis.

### Core Performance Queries

```promql
# Top 5 Slowest Queries This Week
topk(5, avg_over_time(pg_stat_statements_mean_time[7d]))

# Most Active Tables
topk(10, increase(pg_stat_user_tables_seq_scan[7d]) + increase(pg_stat_user_tables_idx_scan[7d]))

# Cache Hit Ratio Trends
100 * (increase(pg_database_blks_hit[7d]) / (increase(pg_database_blks_hit[7d]) + increase(pg_database_blks_read[7d])))

# Connection Pattern Analysis
max_over_time(pg_database_numbackends[7d])
avg_over_time(pg_database_numbackends[7d])

# Transaction Throughput
rate(pg_database_xact_commit[7d])
rate(pg_database_xact_rollback[7d])

# Storage Growth
increase(pg_database_size_bytes[7d])

# Vacuum Efficiency
increase(pg_stat_user_tables_vacuum_count[7d])
increase(pg_stat_user_tables_autovacuum_count[7d])
```

### Operational Metrics

- Connection patterns and pool efficiency
- Lock contention and deadlock frequency

## Instructions

### Step 1: Data Collection & Validation (First 10% of effort)

1. **Gather Weekly Metrics**: Execute all core performance queries for the 7-day period
2. **Validate Data Quality**: Ensure metrics are complete and identify any gaps
3. **Calculate Baselines**: Establish week-over-week comparison baselines
4. **Identify Anomalies**: Flag any unusual spikes or drops in key metrics

### Step 2: Performance Analysis (30% of effort)

1. **Query Performance Review**:
   - Identify slowest and most resource-intensive queries
   - Calculate performance trends vs. previous week
   - Highlight new problematic queries

2. **Database Health Assessment**:
   - Calculate overall health score (1-10 scale)
   - Assess transaction success rates
   - Review connection efficiency patterns

3. **Resource Utilization Analysis**:
   - Analyze I/O patterns and cache efficiency
   - Review storage growth and capacity trends
   - Assess vacuum and maintenance effectiveness

### Step 3: Operational Insights (30% of effort)

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Peak vs. average connection usage
   - Idle connection trends
   - Connection pool optimization opportunities

2. **Lock Contention Analysis**:
   - Deadlock frequency and patterns
   - Lock wait time trends
   - Most contended resources

3. **Maintenance Operations**:
   - Autovacuum success rates
   - Manual maintenance requirements
   - Table bloat and cleanup needs

### Step 4: Trending & Forecasting (20% of effort)

1. **Week-over-Week Comparisons**: Calculate percentage changes for all key metrics
2. **Growth Pattern Analysis**: Identify linear vs. exponential growth trends
3. **Capacity Planning**: Project when current trends will hit resource limits
4. **Seasonal Pattern Detection**: Identify recurring weekly or daily patterns

### Step 5: Action Planning & Recommendations (10% of effort)

1. **Prioritize Issues**: Rank problems by impact and urgency
2. **Generate Recommendations**: Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions
3. **Create Monitoring Alerts**: Suggest new alerts based on observed patterns
4. **Plan Follow-up**: Schedule deeper investigations or optimization projects
